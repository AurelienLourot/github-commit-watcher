# gicowa.py - GitHub Commit Watcher

GitHub's _Watch_ feature doesn't send notifications when commits are pushed.
This script aims to implement this feature and much more.

## Installation

    
    
    $ sudo apt-get install sendmail
    $ sudo pip install gicowa
    

## Quick setup

Add the following line to your `/etc/crontab`:

    
    
    0 * * * * root gicowa --persist --no-color --mailto myself@mydomain.com lastwatchedcommits MyGitHubUsername sincelast > /tmp/gicowa 2>&1
    

**That's it.** As long as your machine is running you'll get e-mails when something gets pushed on a repo you're watching.

> **NOTES:**

>

>   * The e-mails are likely to be considered as spam until you mark one as
non-spam in your e-mail client. Or use the `--mailfrom` option.

>   * If you're watching 15 repos or more, you probably want to use the
`--credentials` option to make sure you don't hit the GitHub API rate limit.

## Other/Advanced usage

`gicowa` is a generic command-line tool with which you can make much more that
just implementing the use case depicted in the introduction. This section
shows what it can.

### List repos watched by a user

    
    
    $ gicowa watchlist AurelienLourot
    watchlist AurelienLourot
    AurelienLourot/uncommitted
    AurelienLourot/crouton-emacs-conf
    brillout/FasterWeb
    AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher
    

### List last commits on a repo

    
    
    $ gicowa lastrepocommits AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher since 2015 07 05 09 12 00
    lastrepocommits AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher since 2015-07-05 09:12:00
    Last commit pushed on 2015-07-05 10:48:58
    Committed on 2015-07-05 10:46:27 - Aurelien Lourot - Minor cleanup.
    Committed on 2015-07-05 09:39:01 - Aurelien Lourot - watchlist command implemented.
    Committed on 2015-07-05 09:12:00 - Aurelien Lourot - argparse added.

> **NOTES:**

>

>   * Keep in mind that a commit's _committer timestamp_ isn't the time at
which it gets pushed.

>   * The lines starting with `Committed on` list commits on the `master`
branch only. Their timestamps are the _committer timestamps_.

>   * The line starting with `Last commit pushed on` shows the time at which a
commit got pushed on the repository for the last time on any branch.

### List last commits on repos watched by a user

`--credentials` option to make sure you don't hit the GitHub API rate limit.

### List last commits since last run

Any listing command taking a `since <timestamp>` argument takes also a
`sincelast` one. It will then use the time where that same command has been
run for the last time on that machine with the option `--persist`. This option
makes `gicowa` remember the last execution time of each command in
`~/.gicowa`.

    
    
    $ gicowa --persist lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot sincelast
    lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot since 2015-07-05 20:17:46
    $ gicowa --persist lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot sincelast
    lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot since 2015-07-05 20:25:33
    

### Send output by e-mail

You can send the output of any command to yourself by e-mail:

    
    
    $ gicowa --no-color --mailto myself@mydomain.com lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot since 2015 07 04 00 00 00
    lastwatchedcommits AurelienLourot since 2015-07-04 00:00:00
    AurelienLourot/crouton-emacs-conf - Last commit pushed on 2015-07-04 17:10:18
    AurelienLourot/crouton-emacs-conf - Committed on 2015-07-04 17:08:48 - Aurelien Lourot - Support for Del key.

    AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher - Committed on 2015-07-05 09:07:14 - AurelienLourot - Initial commit
    Sent by e-mail to myself@mydomain.com

> **NOTES:**

>

>   * You probably want to use `--no-color` because your e-mail client is
likely not to render the bash color escape sequences properly.

>   * The e-mails are likely to be considered as spam until you mark one as
non-spam in your e-mail client. Or use the `--mailfrom` option.
