# gicowa.py - GitHub Commit Watcher

> **NOT WORKING YET.** First version in construction.

GitHub's *Watch* feature doesn't send notifications when commits are pushed. This script aims to
implement this feature and much more.

```
# sudo pip install PyGithub
$ ./gicowa.py watchlist AurelienLourot
AurelienLourot/uncommitted
AurelienLourot/crouton-emacs-conf
brillout/FasterWeb
AurelienLourot/github-commit-watcher
```
